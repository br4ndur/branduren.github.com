This site started out as a small weekend project and wasn't intended for anything, but since I needed a place on da interweb to call my own, I decided to keep it.

This is a Jekyll-powered site and it is hosted on GitHub pages. Feel free to browse, study and use the source code.
But please remove all the content before publishing, and remember to change the configurations.
