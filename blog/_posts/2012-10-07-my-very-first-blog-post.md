Every blog has to start somewhere, and I am starting right here.
I never got around blogging, even though I have been drawn to
computers for as long as I can remember. But I guess I am not alone in
this matter.

## What I hope getting out of it
I always want to learn stuff, and I am sure I will learn something from the process. I would like to to improve my English and writing skills, and what
better way than to write about something I really like ?

That being said, I hope to connect with people who share some of my interest. Oh yeah, and I would love getting some feedback on some of the topics.

## What not to expect from this blog
I am not going to post reguraly, even though many so called blog experts state that I should. I dont have the time, nor do I want to.
Furtermore I keep hearing things like niche blogging is better than general blogging, so a blogger should try to aim for a unique niche - yeah, I am not going to do that here.

## What topics you should expect from this blog
It could be anything that interst me, so I guess it will be mostly geeky topics like:

* Development (eg. C, sml php Java Javascript html5 css3)
* Math (eg. algorthims, proofs, encryption)
* gnu/linux related stuff (eg. shell, emacs, git, tips and tricks)

But you should also expect other stuff.
